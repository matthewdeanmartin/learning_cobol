# TODO

## Command Wish list
- cobol -- installs cobol versions

## Easy-ish
COBOL Instlalations
- list cobc installations

COBOL Build
- clean
- build (compile both modules and main)
  - format
  - test
  - build all

Packaging
- package (to zip files with metadata file)
- install package (from zip file in github)
- list packages
- pipx style installation (not needed? just put on path?)

Scripting
- single file executables with deps?

## Design
- Compare against npm, cargo, pipenv, poetry, etc.

## Difficult
- compile cobc for linux and windows
- unzip that wizard installer
